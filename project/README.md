# Circuit - Final Project CS50x Harvard Course

For my final project, I created a game called Circuit. It is a simple, minimalist, puzzle game. The game includes 10 levels. Here are some basic principles, controls, and rules on how to play my game:
  - You need to connect circles to form a "circuit" (a loop) by creating lines
  - Every circle has to be connected by exactly two lines
  - Mouse is the only thing you will need to control this game. Just hold the left button on a first circle and move it to another and then release the mouse - this way you will connect circles by a line
  - You can not cross the lines
  - If you messed up, you can restart a level using the restart button in the top right corner
  - Your goal is to finish all the levels
